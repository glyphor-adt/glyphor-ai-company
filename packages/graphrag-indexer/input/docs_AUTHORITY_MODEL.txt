# Authority Model

> Last updated: 2025-02-22

The authority model controls what actions AI agents can take autonomously versus what
requires human founder approval. Implemented in `packages/scheduler/src/authorityGates.ts`.

---

## Decision Tiers

| Tier | Approval | Notification | Escalation |
|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Green** | None — agent executes immediately | Logged in `activity_log` | N/A |
| **Yellow** | One designated founder | Adaptive Card to `#decisions` + reminders every 4 h | Auto-escalates to Red after 48 h |
| **Red** | Both founders must approve | Adaptive Card to `#decisions` + reminders every 4 h | Stays in queue until resolved |

Unknown / unmapped actions default to **Yellow** assigned to **both founders**.

## Decision Queue Workflow

Implemented in `packages/scheduler/src/decisionQueue.ts`.

```
1. Agent tool calls create_decision(tier, title, summary, reasoning, data)

2. authorityGates.checkAuthority(role, action)
     → GREEN:  Execute immediately, log in activity_log
     → YELLOW: Go to step 3
     → RED:    Go to step 3

3. DecisionQueue.submit(decision)
     → Write to Supabase `decisions` table (status: 'pending')
     → Build Adaptive Card via formatDecisionCard()
     → Send to #decisions via Graph API (preferred) or webhook (fallback)
     → Record notifiedAt timestamp

4. Decision sits in 'pending' status
     → sendReminders() runs on 4-hour interval
     → If (now - lastContact) > 4h → resend card with "⏰ REMINDER:" prefix
     → Yellow decisions auto-escalate to Red after 48 hours with no response

5. Founder responds (via Dashboard Approvals page)
     → processResponse(decisionId, founder, approved, comment)

6. For YELLOW decisions:
     → Single founder approval → finalize immediately

7. For RED decisions:
     → Track per-founder approvals in decision.approvals map
     → Both kristina AND andrew must respond
     → Only finalize when all founders have responded
     → All must approve for action to proceed

8. finalize(decision, approved)
     → Write to decision.resolved.{id}
     → Clear decision.pending.{id}
     → Log in activity.decision.{id}
     → Status: 'approved' or 'rejected'
```

### Decision Card Fields

When a decision is queued, the Adaptive Card includes:

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Tier badge | `decision.tier` (Green/Yellow/Red with colour) |
| Title | `decision.title` |
| Proposed by | `decision.proposedBy` (agent role) |
| Summary | `decision.summary` |
| Reasoning | `decision.reasoning` |
| Assigned to | `decision.assignedTo` (founder names) |
| Actions | Approve / Reject buttons (rendered in Teams or Dashboard) |

## `checkAuthority()` Function

```typescript
function checkAuthority(agentRole, action): AuthorityCheck {
  // 1. Check GREEN_ACTIONS[agentRole].has(action)
  //    → { allowed: true, tier: 'green', requiresApproval: false }

  // 2. Check YELLOW_ACTIONS[action]
  //    → { allowed: false, tier: 'yellow', requiresApproval: true,
  //        assignTo: ['andrew'] or ['kristina'] }

  // 3. Check RED_ACTIONS.has(action)
  //    → { allowed: false, tier: 'red', requiresApproval: true,
  //        assignTo: ['kristina', 'andrew'] }

  // 4. Unknown action → default to yellow, assign both founders
  //    → { allowed: false, tier: 'yellow', requiresApproval: true,
  //        assignTo: ['kristina', 'andrew'] }
}
```

### AuthorityCheck Return Type

```typescript
interface AuthorityCheck {
  allowed: boolean;           // Can the agent proceed?
  tier: 'green' | 'yellow' | 'red';
  requiresApproval: boolean;
  assignTo?: string[];        // Founder names for approval
  reason?: string;            // Human-readable explanation
}
```
